Crop Production Dashboard Using Excel

This project presents a comprehensive crop production analysis using Excel-based dashboard. The dataset includes information on various crops, states, their yield, area, production, and environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and soil nutrients. The goal is to visualize patterns and insights that help understand crop performance across different states in India. Key analyses include top-producing crops, yield efficiency by state, seasonal trends, and the relationship between environmental factors and crop yield.
